I created this Connect Four game in Python. Following the instructions at the beginning, you can play both players live, or assign bot profiles to one or both players. The bot profiles differ in how many moves ahead they consider and whether they focus on offense (increasing their chances of scoring a connect four) or on defense (blocking the opponent's opportunities to score a connect four).
